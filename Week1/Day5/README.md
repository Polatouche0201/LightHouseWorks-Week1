# Modules

* What is a module in mode?
  - a JavaScript file.
* Why do we have modules?
  - so we don't have one file that's 10,000 lines long.
  - Other people can use our code.
  - We can **re use** our own code.
  - Abstraction & Encapsulation.

## Package Manager

  - distribute easily
  - host somewhere online
  - package browser
  - versioning of code

  `npm`

## Testing

* Seeing if our code works
* `console.log` anything that will tell us if our code is working properly.
